# Always updated and testable docs
Static documentation is a chore and always drifting out of date.

Wait -- do I hear Doxygen, Javadoc and Godoc?
Yes, but these speak about function docs and not how the system is tied together.

What if you could have that system road map,
Godoc like capability and have it alert you when key modules are renamed?
I think I have found that sweet spot!
